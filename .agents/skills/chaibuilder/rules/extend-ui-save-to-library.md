## Custom Save to Library Dialog

Use `registerChaiSaveToLibrary` to replace the default "Save to Library" dialog with a custom component.

**Correct:**

```tsx
import { registerChaiSaveToLibrary } from "chaicore";

registerChaiSaveToLibrary(({ blockId, blocks, close }) => (
  <MyLibraryDialog
    blockId={blockId}
    blocks={blocks}
    onClose={close}
  />
));
```

**Props received by your component:**

| Prop | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `blockId` | `string` | ID of the block being saved |
| `blocks` | `ChaiBlock[]` | The block and its descendants |
| `close` | `() => void` | Call to close the dialog |

**Rules:**
- Singleton — only one component can be registered; last call wins
