/**
 * Prints the ChaiBuilder build banner (with the edition label) to the browser console, exactly once per page load.
 *
 * Two audiences share this console: developers, who want to know which version of the
 * package is actually running before they report anything, and everyone else, who opened
 * DevTools by accident or because someone told them to. The second group gets plain
 * language and the standard self-XSS warning — a console is the usual place people are
 * talked into pasting an attacker's script.
 *
 * Safe to call from anywhere; it no-ops on the server and on repeat calls.
