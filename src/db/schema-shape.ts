 * Core table names come from the (dialect-neutral) core schema so `schema.appPages`
 * autocompletes, but every entry is deliberately `any`: the same query code runs
 * against pg and sqlite table objects (see `asDbInstance`), so column-level typing
 * cannot be pinned to either dialect here. The index signature admits tables that
 * plugins merge in at `registerDb` time (e.g. `schema.appRedirects` from the
 * redirects plugin).
