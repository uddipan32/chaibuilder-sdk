/**
 * OpenAI-compatible provider plugin with a *static* import of the SDK.
 *
 * Same trade as `chaicore/ai/openrouter`: the built-in plugin
 * (`src/server/chai-actions/ai-providers/openai-compatible.ts`) loads
 * `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` through `importOptionalPeer()`, an import no
 * bundler can see — which keeps the package optional, and also keeps Next's
 * output file tracing from copying it into a production build. Installed and
 * configured, the provider then fails only in prod with "could not be loaded".
 *
 * Hosts that ship an OpenAI-compatible endpoint register this plugin instead.
 * It lives behind its own entry point because the import below is
 * unconditional: importing `chaicore/ai/openai-compatible` without the package
 * installed is a build error.
 *
 * Behaviour is otherwise identical to the built-in plugin — same env vars, same
 * activation on `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URL`, and the Vercel AI Gateway still
 * serves every request while that variable is unset.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // chaibuilder.config.ts
 * import { openAICompatiblePlugin } from "chaicore/ai/openai-compatible";
 *
 * buildChaiBuilderConfig({
 *   ai: { providers: [openAICompatiblePlugin], models: [...] },
 * });
 * ```
