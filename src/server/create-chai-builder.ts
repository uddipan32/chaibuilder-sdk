 *
 * Create it once, in one module (`chaibuilder.server.ts` by convention), and import
 * `getChaiBuilder` from there — a real import, so the resolver cannot be left unregistered by
 * accident. It is the same call you already write, with the config baked in:
 *
 * ```ts
 * // chaibuilder.server.ts
 * export const { getChaiBuilder } = createChaiBuilder(config, {
 *   context: async ({ request }) => ({
 *     appId: process.env.CHAIBUILDER_APP_KEY!,
 *     userId: await currentUserId(request),
 *     draft: (await draftMode()).isEnabled,
 *   }),
 * });
 *
 * // route.ts / page.tsx — import from "@/chaibuilder.server", not the package
 * const cb = await getChaiBuilder(props, request);
 * ```
 *
 * This is why the resolver lives here and not in the config: the config stays plain data that
 * scripts, CI, and the Payload CLI can import, while this module owns the framework coupling.
 *
 * Calling it again replaces the registered resolver (last one wins) — dev-server hot reloads
 * re-evaluate the module and simply re-register an equivalent resolver.
