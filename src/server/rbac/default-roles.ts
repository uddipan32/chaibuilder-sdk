/**
 * Built-in fallback role maps used when the `roles` table has no rows.
 * Prevents lockout on fresh installs / before any role has been configured.
 *
 * Once ANY role row exists in the DB, these defaults are NOT applied —
 * the DB is the single source of truth.
 *
 * Contains BASE (core) permission keys only. Plugin-owned grants (redirects,
 * trash, revisions, …) are contributed by their plugins via the
 * `defaultRoleGrants` config key and overlaid onto this map whenever it is
 * used as the fallback — see `applyDefaultRoleGrants` in get-role-permissions.
 *
 * ## Wildcard guidelines
 *
 * `"*"` (grant-all)
 *   ✅ ONLY for roles that truly own the system: owner, admin, superadmin.
 *   ✅ Automatically covers built-in AND plugin-registered permission keys
 *      (wildcards expand against the runtime catalog).
 *   ❌ NEVER use for scoped roles (editor, designer, viewer, user).
 *
 * `"entity:*"` (entity-level wildcard)
 *   ✅ Safe for scoped roles — grants all current + future ops within that entity.
 *   ⚠️  Review when adding a new operation to an entity (e.g. pages:archive).
 *   ❌ Avoid for sensitive entities: users, domains, settings, theme.
 *
 * Explicit keys (`"pages:read"`)
 *   ✅ Safest — no implicit grants, fully auditable.
 *   ✅ Required for users, domains, settings, theme.
