/**
 * Commit messages become the changelog for the `chaicore` package, so subjects must be

 * commitlint job in .github/workflows/pr-checks.yml on every pull request.
 *
 * Host repos that vendor this package as a subtree pull only — they never push commits
 * back — so this is the sole path into the changelog.
